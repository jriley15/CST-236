This is all of our own work, we did not use the internet nor did
we use the learning lounge to help produce our code.

Chips Class - Paramaters/Constuctors/Methods of Chips
Drink Class - Paramaters/Constuctors/Methods of Drink
Driver Class - Paramaters/Constuctors/Methods of Driver
Gum Class - Paramaters/Constuctors/Methods of Gum
Snack Class - Paramaters/Constuctors/Methods of Snack

CLC Dispenser Project:
For our project, we thought out what a person can do once they walk up
to a physical vending machine. We did our best to implement such actions
as methods into our vending machine class, such as inputMoney(), viewProduct(),
buyProduct(), and printReceipt(). We made sure to name our variables and
methods in an easy to read and self-documenting way.

We implemented a comparable interface to our snack and drink class that compares
one object to another based on alphabetic order of the names and also the prices.


How-To-Use:
In order to use our code, you must first copy our code into Java (copy
each respective file into new Java classes in the same package). Then,
you must go into the Dispenser class, scroll down to the constructor
with no arguments, identify how many indexes will be in the Product
array, and instantiate whichever product you would
like into the for loop (whether it be Drink, Snack, Gum, Chips, or
Candy). Once you have done that, navigate to the Driver class, and
create a new dispenser. To test and make sure that you have correctly
instantiated your products, call the displayProducts() method on your
newly created Dispenser. The type of product, name of product,
description of product, and price of product should be printed in the
console for each product that was instantiated in the Dispenser class.
